## Hi there, this is Nicholas! 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on automating software security validation for Amazon, where I am a software engineer

🌱 I’m currently exploring applying Gen AI to DevSecOps. Ask me how that's going :)

⚡ For fun, I've been building a web app for reviewing French Fries, called FryRank, with [@Oxyflush](https://github.com/oxyflush). Check that out in the repos below.
